<h1> Airsupport Quantified Air </h1>

This project is a prototype proof of concept for the Quantified Air project. The point of the application was to make an easier to use product trough offering a better and easier installation process. In the project we tried to keep space for technologies that the actual product may use so that code from this project could be easily merged with that when needed.
